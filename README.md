## Purpose

Chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes are a pressing issue for society. More than one in ten adults in Hong Kong and mainland China have type 2 diabetes, with another 35% (388 million) in China classified as having pre-diabetes. Lifestyle modification is a key strategy for public health and diabetes control. According to clinical best practice guidelines, the first management step for a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is an intensive lifestyle intervention programme of healthy diet, physical activity and smoking cessation. However, these programmes are often designed using standard economic models of behaviour that rely on the assumption of rational decision-making. Sustaining healthy lifestyles choices may be relatively straightforward for the already motivated but is likely to prove difficult for those that have developed chronic health conditions linked to their lifestyle. Insights from behavioural economics have the potential to “nudge” individuals towards behavioural change.
 
Techniques based on behavioural economics have been used to improve adherence to chronic disease management but have not been tested at the early stages of disease, where there lies an opportunity to delay or reverse the onset of type 2 diabetes for newly diagnosed people undergoing the initial lifestyle modification programme.

### Content

A recent review of some small trials of behavioural economic-based incentives are effective in promoting health behaviours such as weight loss, physical activity, and medication adherence. To widen the scope of previous studies, we would like to further investigate the effects of behavioural economics-based incentives specifically on glycaemic control and lifestyle in adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
 
In view of this, the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong would like to invite around 500 participants who have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to participate in a 9-month, four-arm, randomised controlled trial starting in February 2020. Our aim is to investigate the effect of behavioural economic-based incentives against a control group receiving standard care on glycaemic control and lifestyle change, to compare and suggest ways to lower direct medical cost for treatment for diabetes in the public sector in Hong Kong. Those who are eligible for the study will be invited for a brief follow-up session 6 months and 9 months after the commencement of the experiment. Free pedometer and blood tests will be provided. In order to show our great appreciation for participation, each participant will receive a gift coupon upon enrolment and completion of the study.

### Participants
Potential participants should meet the following criteria:
Chinese adults aged 30-70 years
Capable of providing informed consent in either Chinese or English
Newly diagnosed with type II diabetes within the past month (6.5% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 7.5%)

Willing to take blood tests and wear pedometer with smartphone tracking during the experiment
 
Meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible to join the study:
